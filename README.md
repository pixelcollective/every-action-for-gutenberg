# Every Action for Gutenberg

I am not in any way affiliated with NGP VAN and have no involvement with Every Action as a platform. I just support some organizations who use it.

Pretty much:

- Copy/paste URL for Advocacy forms.
- Copy/paste URL for Contribution forms.
- Blocks grouped under "Every Action" heading in the Block explorer.
- One and two column variants for both Advocacy and Contribution forms.
- Bulma stylesheets editor-side.
